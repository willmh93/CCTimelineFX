/**
 * Effect type - extension of tlEntity
 *
 * <p>Effect types are the main containers for emitters and has a set of global attributes that can effect any emitters it stores.</p>
 * <p>The basic entity structure of an effect is: Effect -> Emitter(s) -> Particle(s)</p>
 * Both Effect types and Emitter types have a set of attributes that control how the Particles behave over the duration of the effect and over the duration of
 * the particles lifetime. Most of the effects' attributes scale the equivalent attribute of the emitters to enable a more global control of the emitters 
 * within the effect.</p>
 * <p>The value of these attributes is then looked up over the course of the effect using methods that interpolate between values - the equivalent to looking them up on 
 * a graph. There are 2 ways of doing this: either by interpolating in realtime, or by pre-compiling into lookup tables stored in arrays for faster performance.
 * There is very little difference in accuracy between the two.</p>
 * <p>To do this the EmitterArray is used which stores the value of each attribute overtime for each frame. A frame can be whatever length of time in millisecs
 * you set it to, eg. 30 millisecs. Because there are 2 types of attribute - base attributes and overtime - you can can change the resolution of each one separately. It's
 * more necessary to have a higher resolution for overtime attributes as it becomes much more noticeable. The default resolution for overtime attributes is 1 millisec - the 
 * most precise resolution possible.
 * <p>To adjust the resolution of the lookup tables you can call #SetLookupFrequency which affects the base attributes resolution and 
 * #SetLookupFrequencyOverTime to adjust the overtime attributes.</p>
 * <p>The following table shows each method used to either interpolate in realtime, or compile and lookup the values in an array plus the method used
 * to actually add an attribute value. Click on the add methods for a more detailed description of what that attribute actually does.</p>
 * <table>
 * <tr><th>Interpolation Methods</th><th>Equivalent Compiler Methods</th><th>Lookup Table Methods</th><th>Add Methods</th></tr>
 * <tr><td>InterpolateAmount</td><td>CompileAmount</td><td>GetLife</td><td> #AddLife</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>InterpolateLife</td><td>CompileLife</td><td>GetAmount</td><td> #AddAmount</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>InterpolateSizeX</td><td>CompileSizeX</td><td>GetSizeX</td><td> #AddSizeX</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>InterpolateSizeY</td><td>CompileSizeY</td><td>GetSizeY</td><td> #AddSizeY</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>InterpolateVelocity</td><td>CompileVelocity</td><td>GetVelocity</td><td> #AddVelocity</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>InterpolateWeight</td><td>CompileWeight</td><td>GetWeight</td><td> #AddWeight</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>InterpolateSpin</td><td>CompileSpin</td><td>GetSpin</td><td> #AddSpin</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>InterpolateAlpha</td><td>CompileAlpha</td><td>GetAlpha</td><td> #AddAlpha</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>InterpolateEmissionAngle</td><td>CompileEmissionAngle</td><td>GetEmissionAngle</td><td> #AddEmissionAngle</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>InterpolateEmissionRange</td><td>CompileEmissionRange</td><td>GetEmissionRange</td><td> #AddEmissionRange</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>InterpolateWidth</td><td>CompileWidth</td><td>GetWidth</td><td> #AddWidth</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>InterpolateHeight</td><td>CompileHeight</td><td>GetHeight</td><td> #AddHeight</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>InterpolateAngle</td><td>CompileAngle</td><td>GetAngle</td><td> #AddAngle</td></tr>
 * </table>
 * <p>Generally most of the values returned by these values are stored temporarily in the following variables for quicker access rather then having to
 * look them up again that frame:</p>
 * <table><tr><th>Variable name</th></tr>
 * <tr><td>currentAmount</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>currentLife</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>currentSizeX</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>currentSizeY</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>currentVelocity</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>currentWeight</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>currentSpin</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>currentAlpha</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>currentEmissionAngle</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>currentEmissionRange</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>currentWidth</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>currentHeight</td></tr>
 * </table>
 * <p>To precompile all attributes in the effect and any emitters and sub effects then you can call #CompileAll</p>
