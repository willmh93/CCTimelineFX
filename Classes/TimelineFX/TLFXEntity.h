     * Entity type for basic object information
     * <p>This is the main type for storing entity information such as coordinates, color and other information. This type is designed to be a base
     * type that you can use to extend and create other types, for example tPlayer or tBullet. </p>
     * <p>Entities can be parented to other entities and maintain and update a list of children. These children can be relative to their parents therefore
     *  minimizing the work needed to calculate where entities should be drawn to the screen. If a parent rotates, then it's children will rotate with it and
     * likewise, if the parent moves then its children will move with it as well. Children don't have to be relative however, set relative to false using #setrelative
     * to make the children move independently, however they will still be updated by their parent</p>
     * <p>If you have an entity with children, and those children in turn have children, in order to update all of those entities only one call to the parent
     * #update method is required to see all of the children updated too. This also applies to rendering the entities on screen - by calling #render on the parent entity
     * all children entities will also be rendered. See the code below for an example</p>
     * <p>Entities draw to the screen using tAnimImage, a type that allows for single surface drawing from the singlesurface.mod. To set the image use #setavatar
     * and loadsprite() to set the tAnimImage. You can adjust the appearence of the entity such as colour and scale using commands such as #setentitycolor, #setentityalpha,
     * #setentityscale and #setangle</p>
     * <p>When entities are rendered they can be tweened so that their animation and movement on the screen is smoothed out using fixed rate timing. To do this you need to make a call
     * to #capture each time the entity is updated which stores the entities last position and other details. #Capture is not included in the #udpate method because it makes things
     * too inflexible. There are situations where you might want to specify when exactly you want to #capture the entity. This means that when you extend Entity it's a good idea to 
     * override the update method with your own and include a call to capture within it. Then you can make a call to super.update so that the base update method is still tun. Again, see 
     * the example to see how it can work.</p>
